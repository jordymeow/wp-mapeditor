Create your own maps to plan your future travels and explorations while keeping track of locations you have visited.

== Description ==

Do you love traveling and sightseeing? Do you need to keep track of the locations you have visited, the one you would like to visit and the one you absolutely need to visit? Do you need to filter by their type, by season? That's exactly what this Map Editor is about. It uses Google Maps layer.

**CONTRIBUTORS**. This project warmly welcomes contributors. You can access the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/jordymeow/wp-mapeditor). It is currently using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). From my point of view, priorities would be to:

- Upgrade the codebase to [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)
- Find a new set of icons
- To make it responsive (currently not really usable on mobile)

**LITTLE STORY**. I am Jordy Meow and I travel a lot for photography purposes and for fun: [Offbeat Japan](https://offbeatjapan.org). Google Maps and Google My Maps are useful tools but I needed more features than they allow, so I built this Map Editor for WordPress, for my own use. For 4 years, my friends and I have been usint it on a daily basis. As my technological background evolved, I wanted to make a new, better Map Editor, and [Ikuzo](https://ikuzo.app) is born. It is actually a commercial project with a codebase running on official servers, and backers. For those who are interested in having a free, fully customizable Map Editor on their own WordPress, this WP Map Editor is perfect. You can install it, and modify it as much as you want. Please enjoy it :)

**QUESTIONS & ISSUES**. Please use the [Issues forums at GitHub](https://github.com/jordymeow/wp-mapeditor/issues).
